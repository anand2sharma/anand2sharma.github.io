      <div class="eda-content">
        <p> I have been curious about data and its applications for a while now and recently I decided to take the plunge.
          After lot of searching and reading stuff online I found this fantastic free <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651">cousre </a>
          by Facebook on Udacity to start my adventure with data. I am doing this post to remind my future self and anybody who wants to give exploratory data analysis a Go. Remember I am still a beginer and if have any suggestions or improvements, you are Welcome :).
        </p>
        <p>
          So after having gone though first 3 chapters of the course Udaicty gives an excercise where we have to pick any data of our chocie from Gapminder website and apply our skills that we have learnt so far.
          As I have some intrest in econoics and markets, I went with "Economic growth over the past 10 years" dataset.
        </p>
        <p> Now first thing I need to do was to get myself familer with data and its structure. I had following observations: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provided data has observations for 188 countires over period 1960-2004</li>
          <li>There were lots of small countries which were having missing data values throughouot as late as 1990</li>
          <li>The data is in "Wide" format as there were 188 observation for 46 variables. One variable each for a year </li>
          <li>I need to provide apply proper naming and tranformation on column names</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Asking Questions? </p>
        <p>  On initial observation and exploration it was time to think about what questions we can ask and get answersed by available data?
          I thought We can address these ones: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which country has most consistent growth pattern?</li>
            <li>Is there any country which was lagging behind initially and then saw rapid rise or vice-versa and Why?</li>
            <li>Is there any outlier leader or leggard in growth?</li>
            <li>Is there any co-relation between the growth of two specific countries?</li>
            <li>Any particular year or event which changed the economic growth trajectory of any country for decades?</li>
            <li>Shall We consider those countries which has lots of missing values?</li>
            <li>Shall We consider only top ten countries by GDP?</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Data Cleansing & Transformations </p>
          <p> After forming basic questionaire, We have to transform raw data so we can compute and visualize it. </p>
          <p>We will be using R to explore, understand and transform data. For those who are not familier with R, It is an open source simple programming launguge to manipulate data with tons of liberary availble for free. It has simple syntax so it should be readable even if you are not familier with this language.   </p>
          <p>We will use two R packages, <span class="eda-highlight">ggplot2</span> for creating graphs and <span class="eda-highlight">reshape</span> for data manipulation and <span class="eda-highlight">R Studio</span> for development.</p>
          <p> So lets get started: </P>
            <p> First thing we need is to get the data needed for our exploration. Go to <a class="eda-link" href="https://www.gapminder.org/data/">Gapminder's</a> website and search for "Economic growth over the past 10 years" then download the excel file. As file is in exel format we need to covert it into csv for manipulation. This is a personal choice. You can go with excel itself and there are some really awesome liberaries available that can do the job for you. I personally prefered csv as a format to work with. Second is conversion from excel to csv, There re so many wyas of doing it but for simplicity we will go this Google Docs. Just upload the file into docs and then download it as csv. </P>
              <P> So we got our csv file now its time to import it to have some fun with R.</p>
                <p class="eda-code">
                  install.packages('ggplot2')
                  install.packages('reshape')
                  library('ggplot2')
                  library('reshape')
                  gdp_data <- read.csv('data.csv', sep = ',')
                </p>
                <p>Here we wrote five statements which are pretty self explanatory. First two staements install both the pacakges we need, next two loads the pacakges in memory for us. Every time you start R Studio you have a reload all your dependencies. Last statement import out converted csv file into memory for R to work with. </p>
                <p class="eda-code">
                  gdp_data_top_10_stack <- melt(gdp_data_top_10, id.vars = 1:1)
                  gdp_data_top_10_stack$variable <- as.character(gdp_data_top_10_stack$variable)
                  gdp_data_top_10_stack$variable <- substring(gdp_data_top_10_stack$variable, 2, nchar(gdp_data_top_10_stack$variable))
                </p>
                <p class="eda-code">
                  names(gdp_data_top_10_stack)[2] <- "year"
                  names(gdp_data_top_10_stack)[3] <- "Economic_Growth"
                </p>
                <p class="eda-code">
                  gdp_data_top_10_stack <- droplevels(gdp_data_top_10_stack)
                </p>
                <p class="eda-code">
                  qplot(x=country, y=Economic_Growth,
                  data = gdp_data_top_10_stack,
                  geom = 'boxplot',
                  fill = country)
                </p>

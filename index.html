      <div class="eda-content">
        <p> I have been curious about data and its applications for a while now and recently I decided to take the plunge.
          After lot of searching and reading stuff online I found this fantastic free <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651">cousre </a>
          by Facebook on Udacity to start my adventure with data. I am doing this post to remind my future self and anybody who wants to give exploratory data analysis a Go. Remember I am still a beginer and if have any suggestions or improvements, you are Welcome :).
        </p>
        <p>
          So after having gone though first 3 chapters of the course Udaicty gives an excercise where we have to pick any data of our chocie from Gapminder website and apply our skills that we have learnt so far.
          As I have some intrest in econoics and markets, I went with "Economic growth over the past 10 years" dataset.
        </p>
        <p> Now first thing I need to do was to get myself familer with data and its structure. I had following observations: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provided data has observations for 188 countires over period 1960-2004</li>
          <li>There were lots of small countries which were having missing data values throughouot as late as 1990</li>
          <li>The data is in "Wide" format as there were 188 observation for 46 variables. One variable each for a year </li>
          <li>I need to provide apply proper naming and tranformation on column names</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Asking Questions? </p>
        <p>  On initial observation and exploration it was time to think about what questions we can ask and get answersed by available data?
          I thought We can address these ones: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which country has most consistent growth pattern?</li>
            <li>Is there any country which was lagging behind initially and then saw rapid rise or vice-versa and Why?</li>
            <li>Is there any outlier leader or leggard in growth?</li>
            <li>Is there any co-relation between the growth of two specific countries?</li>
            <li>Any particular year or event which changed the economic growth trajectory of any country for decades?</li>
            <li>Shall We consider those countries which has lots of missing values?</li>
            <li>Shall We consider only top ten countries by GDP?</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Data Cleansing & Transformations </p>
          <p> After forming basic questionaire, We have to trnaform raw data so we can compute and visualize it. </p>
